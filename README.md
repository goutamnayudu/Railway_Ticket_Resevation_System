I am pleased to share that I participated in a hackathon conducted by @Coign at our college on June 15, 2024. The problem statement provided to us was the "Railway Ticket Reservation System."

I, along with my team, worked collaboratively on this project and successfully executed the code. This experience was incredibly valuable, providing us with significant insights and knowledge in software development and teamwork.

Participating in this hackathon was a rewarding experience, and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge gained in future projects.
